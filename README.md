# Blahaj Project: Web Scraping IKEA Store Locations
Welcome to the Blahaj Project! We're on a mission to compare the prices of the beloved 100cm Blahaj (Ikea Blue Shark) plushie across different countries where IKEA stores are located. Our journey starts with web scraping data about IKEA store locations from Wikipedia, then perform web-scrapping to get the prices of 100cm Blahaj from each of the countries. In the final phase of our project, we will conduct a comprehensive price comparison analysis, utilizing the US dollar as our baseline currency. This analysis will enable us to determine the variations in the cost of the 100cm Blahaj across different regions. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights into the cost of living disparities among these locations. 

I have created an interacting visualization of my results in Tableau. Please feel free to visit <a href "https://public.tableau.com/views/IkeaBlahajSharkPriceIndexOct2023/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link"><a/>

# Introduction
Our goal is to identify the countries where IKEA stores are operational and gather data to compare the prices of the 100cm Blahaj plushie in these countries. We'll be scraping information from the Wikipedia page that lists countries with IKEA stores.

# Project Scope
Chile and Macau are excluded from our analysis due to specific reasons mentioned in the project description. With a list of 59 IKEA-ready countries in hand, our next step involves delving into the websites of each country's IKEA outlet to understand their unique HTML structures and gather pricing data.

For web scrapping the Latvia's IKEA website, you may need to use VPN because issues may arise if you are visiting the website from other countries.
